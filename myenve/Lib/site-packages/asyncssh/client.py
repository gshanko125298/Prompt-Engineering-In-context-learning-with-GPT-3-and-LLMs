    """SSH client protocol handler

       Applications may subclass this when implementing an SSH client
       to receive callbacks when certain events occur on the SSH
       connection.

       For simple password or public key based authentication, nothing
       needs to be defined here if the password or client keys are passed
       in when the connection is created. However, to prompt interactively
       or otherwise dynamically select these values, the methods
       :meth:`password_auth_requested` and/or :meth:`public_key_auth_requested`
       can be defined. Keyboard-interactive authentication is also supported
       via :meth:`kbdint_auth_requested` and :meth:`kbdint_challenge_received`.

       If the server sends an authentication banner, the method
       :meth:`auth_banner_received` will be called.

       If the server requires a password change, the method
       :meth:`password_change_requested` will be called, followed by either
       :meth:`password_changed` or :meth:`password_change_failed` depending
       on whether the password change is successful.

       .. note:: The authentication callbacks described here can be
                 defined as coroutines. However, they may be cancelled if
                 they are running when the SSH connection is closed by
                 the server. If they attempt to catch the CancelledError
                 exception to perform cleanup, they should make sure to
                 re-raise it to allow AsyncSSH to finish its own cleanup.
